Welcome to the LEGO Duplo Bluetooth Enhancement repository! This project aims to turbocharge the LEGO Duplo experience for young builders by introducing Bluetooth connectivity to the traditional LEGO set. Through this innovative addition, children can interact with their creations in dynamic ways, opening up a new dimension of play and learning.
