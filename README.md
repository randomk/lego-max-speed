## Introduction

Welcome to the LEGO Duplo Bluetooth Enhancement project! This initiative began as a personal venture to give my son Antonio the fastest and most interactive tracks for his LEGO Duplo trains. By integrating Bluetooth technology into LEGO Duplo blocks, we've transformed how he plays, making it faster, more responsive, and more fun!
